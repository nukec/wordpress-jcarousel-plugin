Wordpress jCarousel Plugin

jCarousel is very well known jQuery plugin for controlling a list of items in horizontal or vertical order. The items, which can be static HTML content or loaded with (or without) AJAX, can be scrolled back and forth (with or without animation). Since I used it in many occasions I wanted to have a WordPress version of this plugin. I developed back end for adding items and front end for proper rendering of those items.

Installation:
- create new folder inside of wp-content\plugins\ and name it jcarosuel(or your name)
- copy the files inside your newly created folder
- go to your wordpress admin-area and you will already see Zoneslider plugin - activate it
- you will find new menu option called Zoneslider in your admin-area menu, where you can add your projects
- use [zoneslider] shortcode to show your Isotope plugin on your front-end
